# Algorithms and Data Structures with ES6
This repo contains basic algorithms and data structures implemented with ES6.

It provides the following features:
* Basic Algorithms with Data Structures
* Sorting: quicksort, mergesort, heapsort
* Dynamic Programming: factorial, max sub array
* Misc: string interview questions (reverse, palindrome), decimal-to-roman-numeral conversion
* Code written in ES6
* Babel transpiling through a simple gulp task
* Linting with eslint using the AirBnB rules
* Unit tests with mocha
* Test coverage metrics with instanbul
* Latest modules used for all dependencies, including babel v6
* JSDoc style comments used to document the code

## Usage
```
import algs4js from 'algs4j'

const arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1];
algs4js.quicksort(arr);

// arr is now [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
